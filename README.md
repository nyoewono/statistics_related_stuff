# statistics_related_stuff

This repository is mainly some of my mini experiment on statistic methods that I am curioused about. This actually help me to understand the method better, as the result of the method can be seen directly by using some toy dataset or environment. 

Hope you enjoy it!

ps: I'm still not an expert in statistics, so I do apologise if I made some theoretical mistakes along the way :)
